# Update Copilot Instructions: Stop and Prompt After Every Step

**Goal:** Update the GitHub Copilot instructions to ensure the user is prompted to proceed after every single step, providing maximum user control over the workflow.

## Plan:

- [x] **Step 1:** Update the "Phased Execution" section to emphasize stopping after every individual step
- [x] **Step 2:** Modify the workflow to clarify that no step should be performed without explicit user confirmation
- [x] **Step 3:** Add explicit guidance about waiting for user confirmation before any action (including plan creation)
- [x] **Step 4:** Update the example workflow text to show the stop-and-confirm pattern more clearly
- [x] **Step 5:** Add a note about breaking down complex steps into smaller, more granular steps
- [x] **Step 6:** Test the updated instructions by reviewing the final version for clarity and completeness
